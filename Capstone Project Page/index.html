            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>People care deeply about their natural surroundings. Our relationship to the environment is a connection to a wider, more complex, existence. It allows one's focus to shift from immediate stresses to the vibrancy of the world and the calming reliability of the seasons. Regional landscapes help define a community, whether agricultural or wild, rural or urban, temperate or tropical, there is pride in how nature reflects local character. Similarly, an individual uses nature to express their values through lawn care, a garden, hunting and conservation, or affinity for a local park. This project aims to engage these tendencies to encourage sustainability and awareness.
            </p>
            
            <p>A single project has a real, but limited, footprint. A single rain garden or pollinator sanctuary can improve the local environment, but at scale a series of similar projects will dramatically improve waterways and create migratory corridors. Similarly, a single project can spark neighborly curiosity and learning while large scale engagement will lend momentum to collective advocacy and education. The intent of this project is to use design to aid this momentum, to create a vehicle to connect small, diverse, individual projects together into an empowering web. Like a Little Free Library it will be a physical marker that will use design to tie unique personal projects to others through intent and execution.
